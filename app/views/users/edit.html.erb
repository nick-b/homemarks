  If you choose to delete your account, it will be immediately deactivated and then deleted by the HomeMarks
  system in <%= HmConfig.app[:delayed_delete_days] %> days. If you do choose to do this, an email will be sent
  to your address on file with a link that will allow you to cancel this action within the
  <%= HmConfig.app[:delayed_delete_days] %> day period.
